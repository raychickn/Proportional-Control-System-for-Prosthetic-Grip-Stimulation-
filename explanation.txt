**Potentiometer:**
- Middle pin → Arduino A0  
- Outer pins → 5V / GND  

**Servo Motor:**
- Signal → Digital pin 5  
- Red → 5V  
- Black/Brown → GND  

**Important:** Connect servo GND to Arduino GND for proper operation.

There weren't calculations involved (if there was it was minor). 

In terms of challenges, at first although the code was working, the server motor was moving slow with a lot of noise.
The wiring got tripped up and i connected Ground to Voltage but fixed it quickly. 

In future, I hope to get my hards on a EMG sensor so I can take this project to the next level, by actually using it on human muscles.
Ill require a EMG sensor and a prosthetic hand, either by 3D printing and laser cutting or my own design.
