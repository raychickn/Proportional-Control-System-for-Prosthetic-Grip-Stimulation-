**Potentiometer:**
- Middle pin → Arduino A0  
- Outer pins → 5V / GND  

**Servo Motor:**
- Signal → Digital pin 5  
- Red → 5V  
- Black/Brown → GND  

**Important:** Connect servo GND to Arduino GND for proper operation.

There weren't calculations involved (if there was it was minor). 

In terms of challenges, at first although the code was working, the server motor was moving slow with a lot of noise.
The wiring got tripped up and i connected Ground to Voltage but fixed it quickly.
